Stable tag: 2.9

A simple directory of where things can be found in a particular city/geographical location

== Description ==
If you are running a website for expats in a particular city/region this can be a valuable tool for people who are looking for those little (or big) items that will make their lives easier.
Designed with the idea of driving traffic to expat sites using user-generated content.  That's the idea in a nutshell.

The list displays 3 columns of information. The first column is a category (which can be customized) the second is an item name and the third is the location. 
The item name and location can also display optional information via a tooltip that is activated if the optional information is entered. 
This list is displayed by putting the shortcode [wcifsearch] in a page or post. This plugin was designed with the intention of having no other content 
within the page or post that displays the list, but other content should work just fine.
